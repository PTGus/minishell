An environment variable's name must start with either an uppercase or lowercase letter (i.e., A–Z or a–z) or an underscore (_). If you try to assign a value to a name that starts with any other character—such as a digit or a special character—the bash will reject it as an invalid identifier. However, this restriction applies only to the name—not the value. However after the first character, you can also include digits (0–9) alongside letters and underscores but still no other characters other thatn these are allowed.

You can assign almost any string to an environment variable, including empty strings.

You can't assign an nvironment variable's value an actual null byte (\0).

Bash doesn’t modify or reject a value based on its content (aside from the null character issue). That means if the program sees a variable with unusual formatting, it’s because that’s the literal string we assigned.

Summary:
Bash will not reject an environment variable value (regardless of its content) as long as we follow proper syntax for the assignment and do not attempt to include a null character. Any string we provide is acceptable; however, if the value’s format is critical for some applications, we might need to ensure it meets those programs’ expectations.
